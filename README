Another chatbot, this one written in node.js. 
Uses a mysql connection by default. 

Edit bot.properties to configure bot. 

Start with:
node botboy.js - To start up bot normally
node botboy.js shell - To start up bot and leave a repl open (play with 'bot' variable)
node botboy.js shell noconnect - Same as above, but don't connect to IRC. Use this to debug message handling
